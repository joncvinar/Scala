//A worksheet is a Scala file that is evaluated on save,
// and the result of each expression is
//shown in a column to the right of your program. Worksheets are like a REPL session on
//steroids, and enjoy 1st class editor support: completion, hyperlinking, interactive errors-as-
//you-type, etc. Worksheets use the extension .

//REPL is Read-eval-print loop
